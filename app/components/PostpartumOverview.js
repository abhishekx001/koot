              Postpartum depression is a common experience among parents after childbirth, characterized by deep sadness and emotional struggles similar to other types of depression. It can range in severity, sometimes escalating to postpartum psychosis. <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Research suggests that 33% of women in Kerala face some form of postpartum depression.</span>

              New moms might find themselves wondering if the emotional rollercoaster they're experiencing is simply the "baby blues" or something more concerning like postpartum depression. While both involve feeling down after giving birth, they're distinct experiences.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Think of the baby blues as a natural period of adjustment. Your body has just experienced a major change, your life has taken a dramatic turn, you're now caring for a delicate new baby, and your hormones are all over the place. Feeling overwhelmed and emotional is totally expected! These feelings typically only last a few weeks and gradually ease on their own.
            </p>
            
            <p className="font-semibold">Here are some typical signs of the baby blues:</p>

              <li>• Bursts of tears</li>

            </ul>
            
            <p>
              <span className="font-semibold">Postpartum depression, however, is much more serious.</span> While some symptoms might be similar, they're usually more severe and last longer than just a few weeks.

            <p>
              Remember, you're not alone in this. If you're having a hard time with your emotions, please don't hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider. They can help you understand what you're going through and offer support if you need it. If you're struggling with postpartum depression, a <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">therapist</span> can be a great resource.

              Postpartum depression doesn’t have a specific "start date." It can begin any time after giving birth, though it usually appears within the first few weeks or months. This often coincides with the hormonal changes women go through after delivery, which can affect their emotional health. However, men are not immune either. The reality of fatherhood, the altered family dynamics, and sleep deprivation can all contribute to emotional struggles in new dads.

            <p>
              Women often face immense societal pressure to be the perfect mothers. Sadly, because of fear of judgment and the stigma around mental health, many struggle with postpartum depression in silence. This not only takes a toll on their physical well-being but also impacts their emotional health significantly.

            <p>
              Therefore, having open discussions about the nature of postpartum depression, its effects, and available treatments is essential. By discussing it openly, women can feel less isolated and realize that reaching out for <span className="text-blue-600 font-semibold">professional help</span>, like through Koott, is not just okay but actually encouraged.
