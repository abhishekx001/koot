              Eating disorders are mental health conditions marked by abnormal eating habits, exercise routines, and body image issues. These disorders often lead to an unhealthy relationship with food, negatively affecting one's physical, social, and psychological health. Eating disorders commonly include anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder. Symptoms can vary a lot, from severe dieting and excessive exercising to overeating followed by attempts to compensate.
